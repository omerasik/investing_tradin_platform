# Deployment Runbook

Development is local and research-only. Future environments are development, test, paper, then production, with signed/versioned artifacts, migration checks, least-privilege secret injection, staged rollout, rollback and backup/restore evidence. No deployment may include live execution without signed readiness approval.

For a PostgreSQL environment, inject the DSN through the deployment secret
manager, set `persistence_target=postgres`, and run `alembic upgrade head`
before application startup. `paper` and `production` configuration reject
SQLite. Perform the SQLite backfill dry-run and resolve every identity conflict
before any mapped write. Downgrades are permitted only for disposable schema
tests; production migrations are forward-only. A failed migration, unavailable
database, stale reconciliation or incomplete restore must leave risk increase
and paper submission fail-closed.

After any restore, run `scripts/verify_postgres_restore.py --source-dsn ...
--restored-dsn ...` against a separately created database. Do not release the
append-only recovery gate unless revision, critical hashes/counts, validation
manifests, OMS reconstruction, broker cursor, risk reservation, kill switch,
promotion and reconciliation checks all pass. A corrupt or incomplete dump is
a failed deployment.

Operational job policies and terminal run evidence do not deploy or authorize a
scheduler. A deployment-owned scheduler may only invoke separately approved job
entry points and must append terminal evidence with a unique idempotency key.
The monitor evaluates durable evidence and may open/recover local overdue alerts;
it never executes due work.

Alert routing currently ends at immutable `LOCAL_OUTBOX` rows whose status is
`PENDING_EXTERNAL_DELIVERY`. Destination references are opaque allowlisted names,
not endpoints. Do not configure network delivery, credentials or a claim of
successful notification until an independently approved adapter implements
retry, current-alert recheck, delivery attempts, escalation and secret handling.
